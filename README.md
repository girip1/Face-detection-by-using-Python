# Face-detection-by-using-Python
Artificial Intellenge project to detect the face by using Convolution neural network technique to solve the face detection. One of the challenges was to be able to recognize a person given just one single image. It is a multi-layer network trained to perform a specific task using classification. It carefully evaluates a small number of challenging candidates in the last high-resolution stage. I used path directory to the files where original images are saved to resize them correctly. After applying the face cascade to detect multi scale xml file to find the face of people, it gave a result where there is a box in each person face. I have used OS, cv2 and PIL library. Using PIL library, we can open images and resize them to their height and width because the video which will be created using cv2 library required the input of images of same height and width. Resized images are included in an array and frame of video is set with their height and width. Then I have used a loop to append each image to that frame. I have achieved face detection by deep learningâ€™s sub filed and is a multi-layer network trained to perform a specific task using classification. Then the process will be applied for test-set images and generates the video.
